# csv2opensearch

Ruby singleton that indexes a CSV in OpenSearch. I wrote something simple but useful and I'd like to share it! 

It assumes that the OpenSearch API is available on `localhost:9200` 






## Usage

First change the username and password with your favorite text editor (TODO: use environment variables for username/pass)

`csv2opensearch.rb <index_name> <csv_filename>`
